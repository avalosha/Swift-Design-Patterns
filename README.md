# Swift-Design-Patterns
Examples of the most used design patterns with Swift

The Design Patterns creates a common language when developing a project, it also provides us with a fast-track to incorporate new developers.

But why a common language? It is because it teaches us the best practices when developing, writing with better structured code, allowing developers involved in a common project to work independently to achieve their common objectives. And this also helps to add new developers to the project faster.

With the advantage of having a well structured code, it allows projects to have easy maintenance and greater scalability, making development speed more efficient and using fewer resources.

For this, it is necessary to know the different design patterns that exist, since not all of them work for everything. So here you will find different design patterns used with Swift, divided into:

* Creative
* Structural
* Behavior
